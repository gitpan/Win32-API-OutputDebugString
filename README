
DESCRIPTION:

This is a trivial extension that supports the OutputDebugString
Win32 API call. Trivial though it is, it appears nobody has ever thought
of making it into a module, so I did.
It is very bare, so if anybody has ideas on what else could benefit it,
feel free to write.

To take advantge of this, you'll need dbmon.exe or equivalent (check at 
sysinternals.com).

INSTALLING:

Building from source requires a development system (Visual C++ or the moral
equivalent):

perl Makefile.PL
nmake 
nmake install

I am making a ppm package avaiable from my CPAN directory for those lacking a
C compiler.
