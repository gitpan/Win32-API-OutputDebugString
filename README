This is a trivial extension that supports the OutputDebugString
Win32 API call. Trivial though it is, it appears nobody has ever thought
of making it into a module, so I did.
It is very bare, so if anybody has ideas on what else could benefit it,
feel free to write.

To take advantge of this, you'll need dbmon.exe or equivalent.
